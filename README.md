# OneForConsecutiveOnes
decting number of 1 present in a series such that if two or more ones are detected consecutively then it will be treated as a single one
* suppose a series 111001011011101100000111111 is given then if we count the number of ones present in it then it would be 17 but what is we need only one count when the number is repeating i.e. 6 should be the count.
