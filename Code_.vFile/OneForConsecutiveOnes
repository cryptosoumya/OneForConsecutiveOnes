To understand the code you must first understand how it is working, you need a model and a state diagram to follow the same
the program is done in .v extension i.e. its a verilog program you would require XILINX software for running the same.
for other programing language the logic will be same while the program will differ

In verilog program we restrict our usage of while and for loops as it way hinder in circuit designing, so the only loop that we use is always
